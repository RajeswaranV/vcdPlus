\title{Given an input matrix, we can split it into smaller sub-matrix (min 2x2) and then find
 the Chi-squared test for each sub-matrix. The smaller matrix can "support"  or "oppose"
 (have a different conclusion at 95% confidence interaval) compared with the overall Chi-squared
 test value of the full input matrix. We count the number of times each cell supports or
 opposes the overall Chi-squared test. We also generate the possible list of sub-matrix.}
\usage{
Local.Odds.Ratio(mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{- matrix for which the sub-matrix is to be generated}
}
\value{
A of dataframes with
 \item{Hot.df}{  Dataframe with the difference between the supporting matrix and the opposing matrix}
 \item{Suport.df }{ Dataframe of the cell counts for support of table level Chi-sqaured }
 \item{Oppose.df }{ Dataframe of the cell counts for opposing of table level Chi-sqaured }
 \item{sub-matrix }{ list of sub-matrix - this is returned only if the details flag is set to TRUE }

This can be used as an outlier detection method as well as observing the individual
cells within an IxJ table
