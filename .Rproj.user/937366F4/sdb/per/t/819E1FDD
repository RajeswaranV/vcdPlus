We comprehensively provide procedures in frequentist (approximate with or without adding pseudo counts or continuity correction or exact) and in Bayesian cultures. Evaluation procedures for CI warrant active computational attention and required summaries pertaining to  four criterion (coverage probability, expected length, p-confidence, p-bias, and error) are implemented.\nLicense: GPL-2\nURL: https://github.com/RajeswaranV/proportion\nBugReports: https://github.com/RajeswaranV/proportion/issues\nDepends:\n    R (>= 3.2.2)\nLazyData: true\nEncoding: UTF-8\nImports:\n    TeachingDemos,\n    ggplot2\nSuggests:\n    knitr,\n    rmarkdown\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\n",
